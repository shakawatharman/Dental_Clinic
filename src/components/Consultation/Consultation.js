                <h1 className="text-primary text-center mb-5"> Video Consultations</h1>
                <p>This page provides information for patients who attend a clinic at Birmingham Community Healthcare and have been offered an appointment via a video consultation platform.</p>
                <br /> <br />
                <h4 className="text-primary">Why have I been offered this type of appointment? </h4>
                <p>In response to the recent outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19), we are reducing the number of people coming into hospital, freeing up space for those who need urgent care and reducing the risk of infection.  We are offering video consultations to some patients who have been identified by their healthcare professional as someone who may be suitable for this type of appointment.  </p>
                <br />
                <h4 className="text-primary">Do I have to have my appointment by video?</h4>
                <p>No.  We understand that it may not be possible for you to conduct your appointment by video or you may not want to.  If you decide not to attend a video call which has already been arranged please let us know by contacting us on the number provided in your appointment email. We can then arrange for your appointment to be conducted in another way.  If your healthcare professional feels that you need to attend a face to face appointment this will be arranged.</p>
                <br />
                <h4 className="text-primary">Where would I go to attend my appointment? </h4>
                <p>Instead of travelling to your appointment, you enter the clinic’s online waiting area which is accessed via the link in the email we sent you advising of the appointment. The health service is notified when you arrive, and your clinician will join you when ready.  There is no need to create an account.  No information you enter is stored.</p>
                <br />
                <h4 className="text-primary">Can I test the video consultation platform before my appointment? </h4>
                <p>You can test your equipment and connection by using the 'Test Call' button on the platform. This will check your connection speed, speaker,  microphone and camera.</p>
                <br />
                <h4 className="text-primary">What happens if I cannot access the waiting area on the day of my appointment? </h4>
                <p>Don’t worry if you cannot access the waiting area on the day of your appointment.  If your doctor or nurse cannot see you in the waiting room they will contact you on the telephone numbers we hold for you.  Your consultation will be conducted by telephone where possible and if a face to face appointment is required this can be arranged.</p>
                <br />
                <h4 className="text-primary">What happens if I am having difficulty seeing or hearing my doctor through the video link?</h4>
                <p>Let your doctor know straight away if you are experiencing any technical problems with the virtual clinic.  Firstly, check your device has access to your camera and microphone. If you are still having difficulty, if possible, your consultation can continue by telephone. Otherwise you can have a rescheduled video appointment or you will be offered the next available face to face appointment.</p>
                <br />
                <h4 className="text-primary">Feedback </h4>
                <p>We will be assessing this service and your experience. Following your consultation you will be immediately directed to an online satisfaction survey. We are interested in honest feedback and we would be grateful if you would consider sharing your thoughts with us. </p>
