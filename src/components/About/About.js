      Today, the Oral Health Foundation continues to be an independent charity
      that aims to improve the oral health of the public by providing free and
      impartial dental advice, by running educational campaigns and by informing
      and influencing the public, profession and government on issues such as
      mouth cancer awareness and fluoridation. We are proud that the values of
      our charity remain exactly the same as when we were first established more
      than 45 years' ago. This is a short summary of how the Oral Health
      Foundation began, what led us to being formed and some of the challenges
      that we faced at that time. Origins On 15 May 1970, in the Café Royal,
      London, twelve leading members of the dental profession and industry met
      for the first time to discuss the birth of a new organisation. Led by two
      prominent and far-sighted members of the dental trade – John M Davis and
      Peter de Trey - the group gathered to debate a paper produced by the
      British Dental Trade Association (BDTA). Titled ‘The Extension of Advanced
      Dentistry’, the paper proposed the creation of a new independent
      organisation which sought to radically change the image of dentistry,
      raise professional standards and seek to educate the public to improve
      dental health. <br /> <br /> A few months later, on 9 July 1970, at the Berners Hotel in
      London, 23 dental surgeons, one dental assistant and six members of the
      dental trade began the challenging process of forming an organisation
      which would be known as the British Dental Health Foundation (later
      transforming into the Oral Health Foundation). Their first step was to
      elect Jack E Manning, a wonderfully enthusiastic dentist and periodontist,
      to set-up and chair a formation committee. Amongst his first tasks was to
      convince professional colleagues, many of whom were sceptical.<br /> <br /> Formal
      meeting minutes from the time noted that ‘Not all dentists agree with the
      need to educate the public to require a better standard of dentistry’.
      Just over a year after the first meeting in May 1970, the formation
      committee published their ideas for the British Dental Health Foundation
      and invited colleagues to debate the proposals at a meeting on 21 May at
      the Royal Society of Medicine in London.<br /> <br /> At the time Jack Manning said:
      “For the past 12 months, I have led a small formation committee to build
      the skeleton of an organisation that could help to create the most
      profound changes in the United Kingdom dental health climate.” The
      proposals were endorsed by the 60 or so people attending the meeting. The
      formation committee started preparations, in earnest, to launch the new
      organisation in which they hoped all could participate. Based out of Jack
      E Manning’s London West End Dental Practice, on 14 October 1971, ‘The
      Association for the Preservation of Dental Health Limited’ was
      incorporated, operating under the name of British Dental Health
      Foundation.<br /> <br /> At the time, it had proved impossible to register the name
      British Dental Health Foundation and it wasn’t until 30 October 1990 that
      the name was changed formally. Despite a lack of public support from the
      Minister of Health and a modest budget of £15,000, including a vital
      one-off financial contribution of £3,000 from the BDTA, the British Dental
      Health Foundation set off on its mission to improve dental health. It held
      its first formal meeting on 26 October 1971 at the Royal Society of
      Medicine and a team of 18 Council members were put in place during its
      first year. <br /> <br />Jack E Manning was voted the charity’s first Chair. In one of
      his first speeches he outlined the challenges ahead, saying: “We must
      offer a new impact – a new approach – to the problem of getting our ideas
      over, using every avenue available, psychological, patient motivation,
      market research, human behaviour or pattern, all must be used to break the
      back of this communication problem. “A new willingness is required to join
      with others who never had the cosy, dignified approach to dental health
      that had gone before. This, I know, will probably make for a rough ride,
      but done with goodwill, co-operation and understanding, will be exciting,
      challenging, and I sincerely hope, exhilarating to those who take part.”
      Over the next forty years, the charity has been at the forefront of the
      concept of preventive dentistry and remains dedicated to its founding
      fathers’ wish to see the preventive message of 'Teeth are for Life' is
      spread as widely as possible, with the aim of improving everybody’s
      overall health.<br /> <br /> On Monday 4 April 2016, the British Dental Health
      Foundation changed its name to become the Oral Health Foundation. The
      rebrand reflected the significantly broader reach and influence the
      charity had achieved globally since its formation. The change also echoed
      the charity’s ambitions and desire provide oral health information,
      education and support on people throughout the world. Another highly
      influential factor in the charity becoming the Oral Health Foundation was
      the shift in terminology which took place over many decades from ‘dental
      health’ to ‘oral health’. It was the recognition that the health of the
      mouth is more inclusive and extended far beyond that of the teeth.
